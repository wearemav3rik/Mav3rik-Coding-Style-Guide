# Tabs or Spaces
Tabs or Spaces have always been the question among developers. The answer to the question is to use `spaces`, 4 spaces to be particular. Ideally, we want to configure our tab keybinding to create `4 spaces`.

## Apex PMD
The team should be using `Apex PMD` to format the code on each Apex class.

Apex PMD uses `4 spaces` for `1 tab` in its configuration.

## VS Code

For VS Code users, the hotkey is `Ctrl + Shift + F` while on the Apex class file.

Another method is to `Cmd + Shift + P` and choose `Format Document`.

## IntelliJ

For IntelliJ, the hotkey is `Cmd + Option + L` while on the Apex class file.

Another method is to go to `Menu Bar > Code > Reformat Code`.
